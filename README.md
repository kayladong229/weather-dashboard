# weather-dashboard
Completed homework for the Module 6 challenge. The purpose was to rely on a server-side API, specifically the OpenWeather One Call API, to create a simple weather dashboard that would allow the user to view the current weather as well as a five-day forecast of a city of their choosing. All of the cities that the user searches for are also stored in the browser's local storage and links to these cities are also stored under the search field so that the user can access the data for these cities again if needed.
